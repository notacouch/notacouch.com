## First time designing

Poly Webteam members had the highest pay on campus (by like $2/hr) because our boss... was a total boss. He had connections, could reboot your work study at the snap of a finger, and would get contracted work partnering with external neighboring organizations like the MTA. This case was quite shy of such a glorious venture but a good experience nevertheless. A motivated professor gave us the opportunity to create a microsite where people could pay to register for an upcoming event. My good friend and colleague <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonysparkpiris/">Anthony Piris</a> handled the client, backend, and payment gateway portions of the project (sorry, and thank you!). As for me? The client only had 1 Word document to offer, and I had to plan and design the site from that alone. I knew I had an eye for design but wasn't sure if I could actually design a site on my own.

  /></a>
  <figcaption>Me: &ldquo;I got you.&rdquo; :: keyboard drop ::</figcaption>
</figure>

I reused the colors, type, and logos available in the Word doc to create this straightforward design that stayed true to both Poly's and VICS' brands.

## Actual static pages from 2004

I actually found a backup of the static pages, you can check the Main, About, and Agenda pages here: <a href="/tangibles/poly/vics/">VICS event microsite</a>. The Agenda page uses _one_ `<table>` for the time versus activity columns, while the activity columns use definition lists, _not_ nested tables for layout. Despite the site's simplicity, I still leveraged hacks, you'll find these `\` in several declaration keys in the <a href="/tangibles/poly/vics/styles.css">styles.css</a>.

## Diving into design

This project ignited in me the need to _know_ what makes for _good_ design and kept me curious if I could ever transition from web development into web design. Possessed with intrigue, I went on to consume books on graphic design, color, typography, and grid systems. I would later be consulted on design-related matters such as for Poly's 150th year celebration DVD for both media within and improving the print on the DVD itself, 3-dimensional layout of the Poly presidential gallery, and was commissioned for work on a poster for the proposed trancontinental maglev.
