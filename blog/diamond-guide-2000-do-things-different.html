<p>
  This was our team&rsquo;s largest project to date. Diamond-Guide.com was a
  massive website that provided tons of information on jewelry and really tried
  to hold their users&rsquo; hands. They had a lot of imagery and they wanted
  pretty much their entire website to be images. And I mean entire website.
</p>
<p>
  Diamonds? Images.<br />
  Jewelry? Images.<br />
  Menu?? Images!<br />
  Body text?1! IMAGES!

<h2 id="layout-2000">Layout in the year 2000</h2>
<p>
  In the year 2000, how did one code the frontend for a site that had enough
  images to block out the light of the sun? That&rsquo;s right. In the dark
  (i.e. table-based layouts). With knives (i.e. Adobe Photoshop slice tool).
</p>
<p>
  Our designers got to work with materials provided to them. They&rsquo;d pass
  me full comps and slice them up in Photoshop based on how I&rsquo;d lay them
  out. For the unfamiliar, layout via CSS was not really a thing. To achieve
  positioning, you created tables with rows all for the purpose of sizing
  columns to your needs and nested tables as much as needed. To achieve
  additional precision, you used spacer GIFs, 1&times;1 pixel transparent GIFs,
  which you could size exactly how you wanted via <code>width</code> and
  <code>height</code> attributes to push things around or otherwise occupy empty
  space:

<h2 id="scrolling-news-ticker">Scrolling news ticker</h2>
<p>
  What I&rsquo;m unable to share is the first JavaScript challenge I was tasked
  with, they wanted a news ticker scrolling on the top right of certain pages. I
  hadn&rsquo;t done anything like this before, and there were no such scripts on
  Dynamic Drive, a site where one would find dHTML or dynamic HTML scripts
  (which is what we called fancy manipulation of the DOM back then). My approach
  to it was positioning a container div absolutely, specifiying its
  <code>clip: rect(...)</code> path, set its <code>overflow: hidden;</code>,
  each piece of content was in its own tag, I would continually shift the
  positioning of each piece until it was almost full circle, at the point I
  would duplicate the contents, append the duplicate to the end, continue
  scrolling until the duplicate&rsquo;s left position was at the start, remove
  the original contents, and repeat <em>ad infinitum</em>. I&rsquo;m curious how
  I&rsquo;d approach this today, but I&rsquo;ll save that for another post.
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">In conclusion, keep things new</h2>
<p>
  This project was intense. So much so, I remember my boss Paul once asked,
  &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Abed? Diamond Guide keeping you up at night?&rdquo;
  To which I replied, &ldquo;No. Diablo II.&rdquo; But it may very well have
  been Diamond Guide!
</p>
<p>
  So why share all this? Partially just to show that this was real, it is the
  only table-based work I was able to reference. Achieving pixel perfect,
  cross-browser, cross-platform compatible design was a thing even back when
  table-based layouts were the commercial or professional methodology of the
  time. Part of the Brainlink way was to never do the same thing twice, so we
  would try to do something differently with every project in the rare case
  something was not already unprecedented to begin with. This principle stuck
  with me and ever since then I have always baked learning and trying new things
  into my work.
