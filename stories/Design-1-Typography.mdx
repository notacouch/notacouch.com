<Title>Typography</Title>

_WIP_ ...

## Choice of type

## Sizes

## Measure

## DPI

## Vertically challenged

### x-height

### She cannah take no more cap'n!

Things that I skipped out on for now:

- typographic scale especially when pairing fonts or delineating sections and nesting in content
- vertical rhythm (super excited to use `rlh` and `lh` units!)
- a smarter approach to vertical margins and gutters, I think I&rsquo;ll continue to brute force my way through this so I have more instances and data to work with in an audit.
