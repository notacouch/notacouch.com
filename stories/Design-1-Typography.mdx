<Title>Typography</Title>

Inspired by [Jeremy Keith&rsquo;s post on designing the Patterns Day site](https://clearleft.com/thinking/designing-the-patterns-day-site), I put books down and got started on my own. I wish I had gone through Richard Rutter&rsquo;s [Web Typography](https://book.webtypography.net/) book first, though! If you do anything related to web design, this is a must-have in your library, how I wish I had a physical copy.

## Choice of type

While I did not leverage the timeless guidance in the aforementioned book, and even though I&rsquo;ve long-since wanted to fashion a site resembling Swiss/International style, I knew I wanted to pair a humanist and serif font. I&rsquo;ve had problems with Google Fonts in the past mostly due to strange routing issues with my ISP, so I just stuck to what Adobe Fonts (formerly Typekit) had to offer. I collected the typefaces that appealed most to me with one for code and one for utility/links usage and threw it in a page to test combinations:

In the end I went with:
- Karmina
- Source Serif Pro
- DarkMode On
- Droid Sans Mono

(For code, I wanted something web-friendly as close to what I use in editors depending on platform, i.e. Meslo LG S & Menlo, but couldn&rsquo;t find a similar font within Adobe&rsquo;s roster.)

## Sizes

In the past, we used to use much smaller font sizes. But testing across devices and screens at my disposal, playing with [Size Calculator](https://sizecalc.com/), I found browser default font sizes were actually pretty good now. I didn't see any need to increase size with wider displays, e.g. just making a window wider or smaller, I&rsquo;m still on the same screen. I have devices with similar resolution but are a fraction of each other&rsquo;s size, going larger in one was worse for the other and vice-versa.  Since there isn&rsquo;t a way of gauging actual device specs and actual approximate viewing distance, again, starting with browser defaults as a base works decently.

### x-height

A great practice I picked up from <u>Web Typography</u> is comparing the x-height of your font against that of a timeless one. I did so with Source Serif Pro against Helvetica, so its equivalent of 16px is more like 17.x, closer to 18px. I left calculations at subpixel values, let&rsquo;s see how that goes.

## Measure

Is there research on how much text should go in a line? Not enough. If we do get there, it will probably not change anything. Again, <u>Web Typography</u>, solid measure for single-column is between 45 and 75 characters. So I tested that against display, header, and body texts using the following CSS:

```css
/*
       For body text: 45-75ch (font) or 23-38em (screen)
*/
      .measure {
        max-width: 75ch;
        position: relative;
      }

      .measure::before {
        content: " 45ch ";
        text-align: right;
        position: absolute;
        top: -1.5em;
        left: 0;
        height: 100px;
        width: 45ch;
        border-right: 1px solid red;
        z-index: -1;
      }

      .measure::after {
        content: " 75ch ";
        text-align: right;
        position: absolute;
        top: -1.5em;
        left: 0;
        height: 100px;
        width: 75ch;
        border-right: 1px solid violet;
        z-index: -1;
      }
```

I wound up going `71ch` for body text.

Display text doesn&rsquo;t play by the same rules.

## DPI

I was surprised to see this be an issue. I was happy with my selection of Source Serif Pro at first. But then I realized I wasn&rsquo;t happy with it on low resolution single DPI screens. The above screenshot is weight 300 on a 2 DPI screen. On a 1 DPI screen, the normal weight (400) was way too thick:

At `font-weight: 300` on a 1 DPI screen, it&rsquo;s a little too light for my liking:

I stuck with it, though, and adjusted `line-height` depending on whether the DPI was 1 versus &gt; 1.

## Vertically challenged

### She cannah take no more cap'n!

_Don&rsquo;t shoot!_

Things that I skipped out on for now:

- typographic scale especially when pairing fonts or delineating sections and nesting in content
- vertical rhythm (super excited to use `rlh` and `lh` units!)
- a smarter approach to vertical margins and gutters, I think I&rsquo;ll continue to brute force my way through this so I have more instances and data to work with in an audit. There&rsquo;s a lot I am looking forward to reconciling given the things new to me, e.g. gap, gap vs vs margin, new selectors, and new units.
