<Title>Atomic Design: Slices &amp; Toppings</Title>

I am a proponent of <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/">Atomic Design</a>, but the naming for atoms, molecules, and organisms sometimes just doesn't sit right with me. Like, at what point do you go subatomic? How do I not think of Ant-Man? When do you go from organism to full on Gundam (mechanical extensions by and for organisms with intellect)? I tend to go way too deep with analogies.

I needed to keep things simple. Pizza came to mind. I love pizza. Most people should love pizza. As I started to refactor patterns of this site into bite-sized components, I figured "slices" could be used for molecules or groups of components and "toppings" can be used for those smaller components that are generally meant for something larger. I'm comfortable with this and don't have to think too deep or too hard. It works for me.

Pies could be organisms, but I haven't gotten that far yet.
