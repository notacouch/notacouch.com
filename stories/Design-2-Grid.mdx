<Title>Grid</Title>

Before starting this site, I had always wanted to make something following international/Swiss typographic style. I popped open my copy of Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann&rsquo;s <u>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</u> and was very pleasantly surprised to read in the beginning:

TODO: INSERT QUOTE FROM BOOK

> block quote

So. Content, [typography](../?path=/docs/design-typography--docs), comes before grid. Given I am verbose by default, this site was bound to be text heavy.

The base of the grid stems from this: I settled on the size and measure of the text body and wanted it off center, to the left.

I also wanted:
- to be able to juxtapose media left and right of each other for a before/after effect
- have an aside for brief tangents
- have smaller media of lesser significant that text can wrap around
- have media match the body more or less
- have media wider than the body
- have code snippets wider than the body
- have code snippets go as full width as possible

There are other chunks of content that have not yet made it to the site, but that about covers it.

## Base grid items

The naming scheme for grid items follows [BEM]("https://en.bem.info/") and [Bootstrap]("https://getbootstrap.com/") (it&rsquo;s stuck in my system &mdash; almost all of Northwell Health&rsquo;s and CitusHealth&rsquo;s projects used one version of Bootstrap or another).

## Breakpoints

Though I was considering moving away from responsive design, maybe towards intrinsic design or something partially fluid, once I had content and some structure going it was basically about trying to fit things based upon the viewport&rsquo;s screen real estate. I tried whatever screens I have available, resizing in Chrome, and tried the 2 iOS phones I have as well. If something didn&rsquo;t fit, expand, contract, and/or move as needed.


### < 900px

### > 900px

### < 1250px

### > 1250px

### > 1500px

Or more accurately 1502px vs 1503px.

### > 1920px

The grid actually can fail beyond this point, so it is reset here and remains the same for anything wider.

<Source code={`
@media (min-width: 1921px) {
  .grid {
    /* original calculations don't work > 1920px via zoom because the text scales down while the free space grows larger */
    grid-template-columns:
      minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 237px) minmax(
        0,
        calc(19.275em - var(--gutter-width) / 2)
      )
      minmax(0, calc(19.275em - var(--gutter-width) / 2))
      minmax(0, 237px)
      minmax(0, 32px)
      minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 1fr);
  }
}`} language="css" />
