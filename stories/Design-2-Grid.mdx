<Title>Grid</Title>

Before starting this site, I had always wanted to make something following Swiss/International typographic style. I popped open my copy of Josef MÃ¼ller-Brockmann&rsquo;s <u>Grid Systems in Graphic Design</u> and read some golden things in the beginning:

> ...the systematic presentation of facts, of sequences of events, and of solutions to problems should, for social and educational reasons, be a constructive contribution to the cultural state of society and an expression of our sense of responsibility.

> Information presented with clear and logically set out titles, subtitles, texts, illustrations and captions will not only be read more quickly and easily but the information will also be better understood and retained in the memory.

So. Content, [typography](../?path=/docs/design-typography--docs), comes before grid. Given I am verbose by default, this site was bound to be text heavy.

The base of the grid stems from this: I settled on the size and measure of the text body and wanted it off center, to the left.

I also wanted:
- (see below) to be able to juxtapose media left and right of each other for a before/after effect
  - This required splitting the centering grid columns into ones that allowed for left/right equal columns (where allowed by the viewport)
- have an aside for brief tangents
- have smaller media of lesser significant that text can wrap around
- have media match the body more or less
- have media wider than the body
- have code snippets wider than the body
- have code snippets go as full width as possible

There are other chunks of content that have not yet made it to the site, but that about covers it.

I feel this is very much a non-standard grid, but it does the things I wanted it to do.

## Base grid items

The naming scheme for grid items follows [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) (it&rsquo;s stuck in my system &mdash; almost all of Northwell Health&rsquo;s and CitusHealth&rsquo;s projects used one version of Bootstrap or another).

_TODO: Need to write this document out._

## Breakpoints

Though I was considering moving away from responsive design, maybe towards intrinsic design or something partially fluid, once I had content and some structure going it was basically about trying to fit things based upon the viewport&rsquo;s screen real estate. This is not an enterprise design system, it is for this site alone, so I can enjoy tailoring by hand instead of imposed breakpoints. I tried whatever screens I have available, resizing in Chrome, and tried the 2 iOS phones I have as well. If something didn&rsquo;t fit, expand, contract, and/or move as needed.

### < 900px

### > 900px

### < 1250px

### > 1250px

### > 1500px

Or more accurately 1502px vs 1503px.

### > 1920px

The grid actually can fail beyond this point, so it is reset here and remains the same for anything wider.

<Source code={`
@media (min-width: 1921px) {
  .grid {
    /* original calculations don't work > 1920px via zoom because the text scales down while the free space grows larger */
    grid-template-columns:
      minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 237px) minmax(
        0,
        calc(19.275em - var(--gutter-width) / 2)
      )
      minmax(0, calc(19.275em - var(--gutter-width) / 2))
      minmax(0, 237px)
      minmax(0, 32px)
      minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(0, 1fr);
  }
}`} language="css" />
